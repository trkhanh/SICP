; Exercise 1.7.

; The good-enough? test used in computing square roots will not be very
; effective for finding the square roots of very small numbers. Also, in real
; computers, arithmetic operations are almost always performed with limited
; precision.
;
; This makes our test inadequate for very large numbers. Explain these
; statements, with examples showing how the test fails for small and large
; numbers.

; If good-enough? is used to search for a square root that is very small, the
; difference between guess^2 and x may be smaller than 0.001, yet not a good
; approximation for âˆšx. For example:

(sqrt 0.000001)

; results in 0.031260655525445276 whereas the correct answer would be 0.001.

; Similarly, for very large input values, the program may never terminate.
; e.g.

(sqrt 20000000000000000)

; Since limited precision floating point numbers are used and once guess is
; sufficiently large enough, the difference to the 'next' floating point number
; may bigger than 0.001. In this case, good-enough? will return false but
; improve won't be able to produce a closer match, trapping the procedure in an
; endless loop.

; An alternative strategy for implementing good-enough? is to watch how guess
; changes from one iteration to the next and to stop when the change is a very
; small fraction of the guess.

; Design a square-root procedure that uses this kind of end test. Does this work
; better for small and large numbers?
